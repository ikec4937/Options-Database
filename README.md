# Options Database

What is this?
A Database System designed for picking options for school children

  How does it work?
  A school admin can go to the booking system’s website and set up an account to represent the school. They (for now) can store five entire school years consisting of at most 150 children and as many as 20 subjects that the school practices.
  Once this is set, the student can visit the website and log in with their school’s account first and their student account afterward. Once they are, they’ll see the subjects available for them

  Who is this for?
  Young children within the ages 15 to 16 choosing their options for a school’s sixth form or college and teachers/IT staff who want a better, easy-to-access and maintainable system that can last for years.

  What’s it supposed to look like?
  MyMaths meets t, basically

Yeah, and then what?
Probably a subscription service that increases everything
-	Plan (default, for small and uninteresting schools)
  o	150 in-school students + 50 guest applications for 5 years
  o	20 subjects
  o	3 slots
-	Plan++ (larger, for fairly large schools with a fair amount of popularity)
  o	250 in-school students + 250 guest applications for 10 years
  o	40 subjects with option for grouping
  o	5 slots
-	Plan# (Royal Russel)
  o	400 in-school students + 500 guest applications for as long as the site lives, and labels for children (If disabled, neuro-diverse, suffering from mental illness, problem child)
  o	Unlimited subjects with option for grouping and exclusivity for select few children
  o	Unlimited slots

Why am I doing it?
I’m doing this for my school because they’re trash lol.

How am I doing it?
I’m using Python for convenience; I know the language best and have experience creating websites in that thing. I’m not using PHP because I don’t like it. It’s not as if my experience is horrible, I find it difficult to work with compared to Python. Aside from PHP, I’m not using any other language because I want this to actually be done before June 2022.
